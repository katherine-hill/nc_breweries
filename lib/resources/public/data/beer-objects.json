They all gave inspiration for Springboard Ale. It starts with our sustainability director's acupuncturist. The acupuncturist had a dream about making a beer with New Belgium. And New Belgium had a brewmaster who was searching for the right ingredients to blend with our wood-aged beer.\r\n\r\nSo, the sustainability director, the acupuncturist, and the brewmaster gathered in front of a wall of Chinese herbs. The outcome of their brainstorm was Springboard Ale. While ingredients like Gogi berries and Schisandra might sound funny, the taste leaves you smiling for more.

Everything shut down for a couple days – no work, no school, no cars. The only way you could get around was by ski or toboggan. When we began brewing Snow Day, we looked to this one storm for inspiration. The dark characters of the malt bill reflect the dark stormy sky at the beginning of the snowfall. But on the third day, the sun broke through and everything was glorious! The name Snow Day evoked joyful freedom. Everyone remembers waiting for the school report as little kids. When you heard your school was closed, you suddenly had all day to play in the transformed, white landscape. Well, that’s the kind of emotion we put into this beer.\r\n\r\nPleasantly hoppy, Snow Day carries the subtle chocolate and caramel flavors of a new brewing malt known as Midnight Wheat. The Styrian Golding, Centennial and Cascade hops bring the backbone of hoppy bitterness to complement the roasty undertones. This beer is the deep garnet of a roasted walnut and presents a creamy tan head, floating artfully atop.

Brewed with Munich malts, a pinch of rye, and traditional Belgian yeast, the beer delivers food friendly flavors like black pepper, baked bread crust, and subtle fruit. But wait, there’s more: We added a delightfully hoppy spin to the style, creating a sip that whisks a taste of the tropics into the Old World. Nelson Sauvin and Chinook hops buoy the beer’s fruit notes with threads of citrus, guava and pineapple for a sip that’s bursting with flavor.\r\n\r\nWho needs summer? We can’t wait until fall to share this new farmhouse ale with you. Stay tuned.","rating":0,"brewery_id":3},{"id":119,"name":"Lips of Faith: La Terroir","kind":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","description":"Le Terroir is a french term meaning “of the earth”.

It was made in very limited quantities, only about 150 cases were made.\r\n\r\nAbout the name: Bardstown is the county seat for Nelson County, Kentucky and is the host city of the annual Bourbon Festival. Most of the famous bourbons made hail from this area of Kentucky. A few years ago Steven was visiting Bardstown and the many distillers around Kentucky.While visiting the distilleries, Steven arranged to pick up some freshly used barrels, empty less than a day. The barrels were brought back to the brewery and filled right away. The barrels rested in the brewery for a year, full of barley wine. \r\n\r\nWhen the beer was just right, the barrels were emptied into a tank and allowed to condition before being bottled, one at a time, by hand. \r\n\r\nAs Bardstown is such a big and robust beer, as well as being 10%, it will age very well, becoming more mellow as the years pass.

This beer is the French cousin of the Spring Brew.\r\n Both were brewed for the farmhands so they had something to drink during the harvest. Biere de Garde means Beer to store or beer to keep. Our version is light amber in color. A good portion of Munich malt helps give this beer a nice sweet malt flavor. It’s left unfiltered.

The malts used were 60% Pilsner and 40% Wheat. Spalt hops were used subtly. What makes this wheat beer unique is the yeast strain used. It gives the beer Banana, Clove and citrus flavors. This beer is an unfiltered beer and the large portion of wheat makes this beer very hazy, which is how it’s supposed to be. No lemon is required for this beer. All a lemon does is dissipate the foamy head of the beer. Plus there are no lemon trees in Germany so you wouldn’t catch a German adding a lemon to a finely made Hefe. El Jefe in Spanish means the Boss. This beer truly is \"The Boss\"!","rating":0,"brewery_id":9},{"id":322,"name":"Dram Tree Scottish Ale","kind":"British Origin Ales","description":"Our House specialty.

This is by far our lightest bodied beer on the menu currently. This beer was made with Pilsner malts and a significant amount of Corn to lighten the body up even further. The corn flavor is fairly subdued, but the beer has a sweet corn-like aroma. Hops were used very sparingly.

East Kent Goldings hops give this beer a nice earthy aroma and flavor. English Crystal malt give this ale a nice red color and a touch of caramel flavor.","rating":0,"brewery_id":9},{"id":315,"name":"ABSURDITY: BELGIAN IPA","kind":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","description":"Absurdity is a beautiful contradiction. Mad science! We’ve taken our deceptively drinkable Belgian Tripel and crossed it with a bold American IPA. The result is a smooth, refreshing golden beer with big citrusy flavors of tangerine and grapefruit, subtle complexities of clove, bubble gum, and smarties candies, and a drying finish. Less bitter than most IPAs; more refreshing than most Belgians. Absurdly good. Let it warm to taste the full complexity.","rating":0,"brewery_id":9},{"id":314,"name":"80 SHILLING","kind":"British Origin Ales","description":"Our 80 Shilling is deep red in color and very malt accented. Very little hop flavor or aroma is evident. It is basically our Scottish Ale’s little sister. This ale is lower in alcohol than the Scottish Ale. To give this beer caramel flavor, Our Brewmaster took a portion of the first runnings of wort and transferred it to the kettle.The Brewmaster then boiled these runnings for an hour to caramelize and reduce the wort. This gave the beer a nice caramel flavor. Scottish breweries list their products in ascending order of gravity and strength as Light, Heavy, Export and Strong. In the past, beer in Scotland was taxed based on strength, so the beers became known by their tax ratings: 60 shilling, 70 shilling, 80 shilling, 90 shilling.

When she heard about my Wilma’s Wandering EyePA she was instantly jealous and looked at Larry and stated matter of fact that she wanted a beer named after her. Now I know that this seems ordinary but you have to know that Abby was 9 years old at the time.

The British found that in sending beer to their troops stationed in India they needed to add more hops to act as a preservative. In doing so the added bitterness created a newly sought after flavor profile inevitably leading to the birth of the Imperial IPA. Laila’s Midnight takes the experiment a step further by adding a dash of nutty Midnight malt and a few other inspired hints of roasted malt flavor to produce a well-balanced and mystically vibrant dark IPA.","rating":0,"brewery_id":127},{"id":2185,"name":"La Belge aDorẻe","kind":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","description":"La Belge aDorẻe as written has a double meaning of “The Belgian Adored” (adorẻe) as well as “The Belgian Golden” (Dorẻe).

Dating back to the 1800’s, the Saison originated in Wallonia, a French speaking region of southern Belgium. Traditionally brewed in the winter months, saisons would age until the summer when they were brought out for the farmhouse workers of the time who were allotted to imbibe up to five liters each workday as a way to combat dehydration when local water supplies were unfit for consumption. Slightly dry and with a hint of citrus, our saison’s complexion is subtle but distinctive and has quickly become one of our favorite session beers.","rating":0,"brewery_id":127}]},{"id":128,"name":"One World Brewing","location":"Asheville","beers":[{"id":2191,"name":"Saison Of Love","kind":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","description":null,"rating":0,"brewery_id":128},{"id":2190,"name":"Black Wolf Smoked Stout","kind":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","description":"Brewed with Beechwood smoked malted barley, this autumnal offering reminds one of good times around a campfire.

Our interpretation was inspired directly by Pierre Celis and his original efforts to resurrect this beloved style. This beer is an unfiltered Witbier or “White Beer” to the Flemish-speaking Belgians because of its opaque, white appearance. It measures 4.4% ABV and is a wonderfully refreshing, easy drinking beer enjoyed throughout the year. Its grain bill includes nearly 50% unmalted wheat and oats while it is very lightly spiced with Coriander, Orange Peel, and a touch of other unique flavors. The yeast in this recipe was cultured from the original strain near the town of Hoegaarden in Belgium and adds a pleasant fruitiness during fermentation. Enjoy this beer with or without an orange slice.

A fairly strong beer with an ABV of 6.6%, Saison’s were traditionally brewed in the winter strong enough to preserve them for the following year’s harvest but light enough to quench the farmhands’ thirst. Our rendition of this beer will transport you back in time, where you’ll be greeted with an array of distinctly Belgian flavors.

Our beer engineers hand selected the brew and blend using ten of their favorite coffees and a double blind taste test. In this limited taproom-only bottle release, the hops take a back seat by adding some delicate floral notes and our blend of four malts and locally roasted, cold brewed coffee take the spotlight.

To recreate this regional specialty, we imported all of the ingredients from the countries that birthed the style. The end result is a malt-forward amber with deep hints of caramel and candied apple. Eight different specialty malts come together to yield a magnificently complex malt profile. The French Strisselspalt hops used for aroma create a mildly spicy and floral bouquet.
