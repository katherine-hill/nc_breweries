These beers traditionally contain a distinct roasted malt flavor and can run the gamut from a dry stout, such as Guinness to a sweet stout such as Watney’s Cream Stout.

A few years ago Steven was visiting Bardstown and the many distillers around Kentucky.While visiting the distilleries, Steven arranged to pick up some freshly used barrels, empty less than a day.  The barrels were brought back to the brewery and filled right away. The barrels rested in the brewery for a year, full of barley wine. \r\n\r\nWhen the beer was just right, the barrels were emptied into a tank and allowed to condition before being bottled, one at a time, by hand. \r\n\r\nAs Bardstown is such a big and robust beer, as well as being 10%, it will age very well, becoming more mellow as the years pass.

Technically, OMB Copper is an ale due to the type of yeast it’s made from (Obergärig or top fermenting yeast).  However, a long time ago the folks in Düsseldorf learned that by lagering their Alt for several weeks after primary fermentation they could produce a full-flavored, yet smoother and more refreshing beer. OMB uses authentic ingredients in our Copper Altbier, including expensive (but worth it) noble Bavarian hops. We also adhere to traditional, time consuming, costly decoction brewing techniques to produce this copper hued, amazingly satisfying “lagered ale.”","kind":"German Origin Ales"},{"name":"Rein Pale Ale","description":"The Rein Pale Ale (RPA) is a cross between an American-style pale ale and a German-style lagered ale.
